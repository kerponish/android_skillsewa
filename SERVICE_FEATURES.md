# Service Management Features

This document describes the new service management functionality added to the Kotlin Sample app, similar to the existing product management system.

## Overview

The service management system allows users to add, view, update, and delete services provided by various professionals like carpenters, electricians, plumbers, etc.

## Features

### 1. Service Model (`Service.kt`)
- **serviceId**: Unique identifier for the service

- **price**: Service price in NPR
- **description**: Detailed description of the service
- **duration**: Estimated time to complete the service
- **location**: Service location
- **contactNumber**: Contact number of the service provider

### 2. Repository Layer
- **ServiceRes**: Interface defining service operations
- **ServiceResImpl**: Firebase implementation for service CRUD operations
- **ServiceViewModel**: ViewModel for managing service data and operations

### 3. UI Components

#### AddServiceActivity
- Form to add new services
- Professional type dropdown selection
- Input validation
- Firebase integration for data persistence

#### GetServicesActivity
- Display all services in a scrollable list
- Filter services by professional type
- Delete and update functionality for each service
- Refresh capability

#### UpdateServiceActivity
- Pre-populated form for editing existing services
- Same validation as add service

- Each service has a unique ID generated by Firebase
- Real-time synchronization with the database

### Architecture
- Follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
- Repository pattern for data access
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Material Design 3 components

### Testing
